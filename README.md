# Next.js Passwordless Authentication with NextAuth.js and Prisma
In [this guide](https://codelabsacademy.com/blog/passwordless-login-nextjs13-nextauth-prisma), you'll find step-by-step instructions on how to set up and configure passwordless authentication using NextAuth.js in your Next.js project. We'll also explore how to integrate Prisma as the database adapter, enabling smooth communication between your application and the database.

## Getting Started

First, updaet your `.env` file to include all required environment variables. Next, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

Go to [http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin](http://localhost:3000/api/auth/signin) to test the passwordless login created using NextAuthJS
